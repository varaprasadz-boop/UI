# Web UI Starter

This repository contains a lightweight, responsive Web UI starter built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What's included

- `index.html` - page structure and UI sections
- `styles.css` - responsive styling with light/dark theme support
- `script.js` - interaction logic (theme toggle + dynamic task list)

## Run locally

You can open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve it with a local static server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

## Customization ideas

- Connect the task list to an API for persistence
- Replace static metric cards with real backend data
- Split styles and scripts into component-focused modules
